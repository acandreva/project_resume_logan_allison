                <h2>Ronald Dupont</h2>
                    <h3>Editor at Venice Gondolier Sun</h3>
                    <p>Allison Candreva interned at The North Florida Herald as a copy editor and established herself as one of the very best we’ve had at that position.</p>
                    <p>Allison had gotten so good at her copy editing that she had old-timers such as myself worrying about what “mistakes” she may find in our writing. I also was impressed how quickly she caught on to the importance we place on...more.</p>
                    <p>Dec. 5, 2011, Ronald managed Allison at North Florida Herald</p>

                <h2>Thomas Twitchell</h2>
                    <h3>Copy editor at The New York Times News Service</h3>
                    <p>Working with Allison is a pleasure. She's smart, she's fast, and she has proved herself in many different roles. Stories that Allison edits routinely appear in top newspapers around the globe, with a potential audience of millions. With Allison on board, those papers -- and their readers -- are always well-served.</p>
                    <p>Dec. 13, 2011, Thomas worked directly with Allison at The New York Times Editing Center</p>

                <h2>Christine DiGangi</h2>
                    <h3>Reporter/Editor at Credit.com</h3>
                    <p>Allison introduced me to The New York Times news service when I arrived as an intern, and she continued to help me grow as an editor after I joined the staff as a full-time employee. She was my mentor during my intern days, providing me with feedback, encouragement and support as I learned the editing system, and she gave me the necessary feedback I needed to improve. As a smart, approachable colleague, Allison quickly helped me and other newcomers learn about our positions, answering all and any questions along the way. She is a great teammate and leader who sets a wonderful example in the workplace.</p>
                    <p>January 8, 2012, Christine worked indirectly for Allison at The New York Times Editing Center</p>
