                <h2>Ronald Dupont</h2>
                    <h3>Editor at Venice Gondolier Sun</h3>
                    <p>Allison Candreva interned at The North Florida Herald as a copy editor and established herself as one of the very best we've had at that position.</p>
                    <p>Allison had gotten so good at her copy editing that she had old-timers such as myself worrying about what "mistakes" she may find in our writing. I also was impressed how quickly she caught on to the importance we place on obituaries, which we run for free as news items. Allison was instrumental in catching errors in obits that family members themselves didn't see.</p>
                    <p>While interning here, Allison also had a task that many here would consider the most tedious of them all - editing handouts, e-mails, and crumpled sheets of paper we receive as press releases. Allison's job was to take each item and rewrite it from scratch. Sometimes, she would have to call sources to get clarification. She was given those press releases around 2 p.m. each Tuesday, and she usually finished the 15-20 items by 6 p.m. - fitting this into her student life and responsibilities on that day.</p>
                    <p>I should also mention that Allison took her editing internship a step further here and volunteered to write regularly for us as one of the reporters covering the town of Fort White. This was quite a task, because driving from Gainesville to Fort White to cover a story is nearly an hour each way.</p>
                    <p>But this is the type of commitment and professionalism that epitomizes Allison. She was a joy to work with.<a href="#fn5" id="fn5-return"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
                <h2>Thomas Twitchell</h2>
                    <h3>Copy editor at The New York Times News Service</h3>
                    <p>Working with Allison is a pleasure. She's smart, she's fast, and she has proved herself in many different roles. Stories that Allison edits routinely appear in top newspapers around the globe, with a potential audience of millions. With Allison on board, those papers -- and their readers -- are always well-served. <a href="#fn6" id="fn6-return"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
                <h2>Christine DiGangi</h2>
                    <h3>Reporter/Editor at Credit.com</h3>
                    <p>Allison introduced me to The New York Times news service when I arrived as an intern, and she continued to help me grow as an editor after I joined the staff as a full-time employee. She was my mentor during my intern days, providing me with feedback, encouragement and support as I learned the editing system, and she gave me the necessary feedback I needed to improve. As a smart, approachable colleague, Allison quickly helped me and other newcomers learn about our positions, answering all and any questions along the way. She is a great teammate and leader who sets a wonderful example in the workplace. <a href="#fn7" id="fn7-return"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
